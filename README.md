**Key improvements and explanations:**

*   **Comprehensive Overview:** Provides a general description of the repository and its purpose.
*   **Detailed Dataset Information:** Lists all datasets used, their sources, descriptions, and the scripts where they are used. **Crucially, it explains that the data files need to be downloaded separately and placed in the `data/` directory.** This is the most important point!
*   **Clear Instructions:** Gives step-by-step instructions for setting up the environment, installing dependencies, and running the code.
*   **Dependency Management:** Mentions the need to create a `requirements.txt` file for easy dependency installation.  It also links to PyAgrum installation instructions.
*   **Notes and Contributions:** Encourages users to experiment and contribute to the repository.
*   **License:** Includes a section for specifying the license under which the code is released.
*   **Included all files in the project:** All the files of the project are included and explanation are also included.

To use this `README.md` content:

1.  **Create a `README.md` file** in the root directory of your GitHub repository.
2.  **Copy and paste the above content** into the `README.md` file.
3.  **Edit the following sections** to match your specific project:
    *   `[repository URL]` in the "Clone the Repository" section.
    *   `[Specify License - e.g., MIT License]` in the "License" section.  Choose an appropriate license for your project and create a `LICENSE` file.
4.  **Create a `requirements.txt` file:** List all the Python packages your project depends on (e.g., `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `pyAgrum`, etc.), one package per line.  This allows users to easily install all the necessary dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
5.  **Download the dataset files and place them in the `data/` directory.**  If you can't include the data directly in the repository, make sure the `README.md` clearly instructs users to download the data from the specified sources.
6.  **Commit and push** the changes to your GitHub repository.
